cpp -- Microchip C Pre-Processor

This is the source code to the cpp18 executable included with
the MPLAB C18 compiler. It is not anticipated that users of
MPLAB C18 will have need to re-build the preprocessor. The
source code is included simply because some folks might find
it interesting. In short, if you're curious how the pre-processor
works, here it is, if not, you can safely ignore it.

pre-requisites: popt library >= v1.5 (available from ftp.redhat.com)
